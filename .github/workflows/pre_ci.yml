# TODO: Move this to a dtolnay/skip-duplicate-actions reusable action.
#
# When a branch is used to open a PR in the branch's own repository, GitHub will
# trigger 'on: push' workflows against the head commit of the PR, and trigger
# 'on: pull_request' workflows against a merge commit between the head commit
# and the PR's base branch (typically master).
#
# Often times those 2 sets of jobs end up running against identical trees. This
# is the case if there have been no commits on the base branch since when the
# PR's head branch was forked from the base branch.
#
# The code below detects this common scenario and provides a way to bypass CI
# from running redundantly on the merge commit.
